      <h1>Get to Know Brittany</h1>
      <p> I am currently a Staff Cybersecurity specialist that has over 2 year experience in full-stack software development.
        Most of my development experience is with html, javascript, bootstrap, css, oracle, jquery, ajax, and entity framework; however, I have dabbled in 
        a few other languages.  Take a look at the summary below.  If you would like more details, please hover or click
